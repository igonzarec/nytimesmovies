# ingenio_challenge

A project that displays movies from NYTimes api.

## Getting Started

The project seeks to follow the clean architecture pattern, which divides the app into layers to maintain decoupled data and separation of concerns. It uses simple but fancy widgets such as 'Listview.separated' and 'Hero'. I also added a simple test where I mock an api call and parse the fake response.
